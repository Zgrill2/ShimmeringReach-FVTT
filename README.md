# ShimmeringReach-FVTT
A [Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com/) Virtual Tabletop implementation of the Shimmering Reach Tabletop system

## What is complete?
* Dicepools roll as a d6 system counting 5s and 6s as successes
* Character sheets populate proper data and have on-sheet buttons for rolling attacks, skills, etc
* Weapon item sheets complete, weapons can be toggled as equipped
* Initiative gets rolled and combatants are sorted each round

## What is coming?
* Togglable custom character buffs/debuffs that modify raw numeral values like defenses, soaks, and skills

## Future Plans
* Ability data will be populatable in character sheets
* Initiative affecting abilities will automatically apply their effects before combatants are sorted
* Multi target weapon attacks ask for a dicepool split and apply reach
* Ability qualifications, tradition affinities, and character points will be populated and tallied
* In system rulebook viewer
